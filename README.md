## Django Sports Quiz Game 
### Introduction
This app is a sports quiz game. My goal for the project was to build a fun website with the new technologies that I learnt(python, Django, Ajax).

You can play the quiz by choosing a specific sport category and the number of questions you'd like. Registered users can add new questions, edit them and delete them. Also the quiz score is saved for the registered users.

The website is built using Python/Django for the backend with SQLite3 database and styled with semantic UI.
